Welcome to the Machine Learning Perceptron Project repository! ðŸš€

This project is an in-depth exploration of the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification tasks. By integrating advanced machine learning techniques and a comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline, we aim to provide a holistic understanding of the algorithm's capabilities and limitations.

## Project Overview

The primary objectives of this project include:

- Implementing the Perceptron algorithm from scratch and analyzing its performance on various datasets.
- Incorporating data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the model.
- Conducting feature engineering and selection to optimize the model's predictive capabilities.
- Leveraging deep learning frameworks for comparison and performance evaluation.

## Features

âœ¨ Data Augmentation with Noise Addition: Enhancing the generalization capacity of the model.
âœ¨ Automatic Feature Selection: Selecting the most informative features to avoid overfitting.
âœ¨ Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Simplifying complex data representations for better visualization.
âœ¨ Kernel-Based Methods: Exploring non-linear feature mappings for intricate pattern recognition.
âœ¨ Deep Learning Techniques with TensorFlow: Implementing a neural network for comparison and analysis.
